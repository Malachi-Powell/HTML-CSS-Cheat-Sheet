 <h1><p style="color: white;">CSS section 1</p></h1>

<p style="color: white;">CSS stands for Cascading StyleSheet. This allows developers to create rules that specify how the content of an HTML element should appear on the web page. CSS works in connection with html elements. A single CSS rule is indicated by the opening and closing curly braces {} and contains 2 parts, the selector and declaration.</p>

<h2><p style="color: white;">The Point Of Using CSS</p></h2>

<p style="color: white;">CSS is used to define styles for web pages, including design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. It also allows HTML to be more content focused by removing the style formatting from HTML page and it in general just saves a lot of work.</p>

<h2><p style="color: white;">Selectors and Declarations</p></h3>

<p style="color: white;">Selectors indicate which element the rule will apply to. A single rule can apply to many elements by separating the selectors by a comma. Declarations indicate how the element will be styled. All declarations must end with a semicolon ( ; ).</p>

<p style="color: white;">Declarations are also made up of two parts. Properties: indicate which styling feature or aspect the developer wants to change.Value: indicates how the developer wants to change that feature. </p>

<p style="color: white;">Selectors are made up of two parts as well. Selectors allow you to target or select specific HTML elements and add style. selectors are case sensetive too</p>

<h2><p style="color: white;">Different kind of selectors</p></h2>

<li><p style="color: white;">Element selectors: Selects HTML elements based on their element name</p></li>
<li><p style="color: white;">Class selectors match an element/elements whose class attribute has a value that matches. When using a class selector in CSS, a period (.) must be placed before the class of the element. An HTML element can have more than one class. Also, more than one element can have the same class value</p></li>
<li><p style="color: white;">ID selectors use the id attribute to select specific elements. When selecting an HTML element with an id, a hashtag ( # ) is placed before the element. IDs are unique and can only be used one HTML element</p></li>
<li><p style="color: white;">Universal Selector using an asterisk ( * ), targets all HTML elements on the page</p></li>
<li><p style="color: white;">Child Selector match the element that is a direct child of another element. Child selectors target elements that are the children of another element but not other elements on the page</p></li>
<li><p style="color: white;">Descendant selectors match the element that is a descendant of another specified element. A space between the elements denotes ancestor/descendant relationship</p></li>

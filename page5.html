When creating the CSS style sheets the file must be saved with a .css extension. Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet.

        <p style="color: white;">The rel attribute, mandatory, specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. The value should be stylesheet when linking to a CSS file.
            type:This specifies the type of the document being linked to.

            <p style="color: white;">Internal stylesheets are applied by placing the CSS rules inside of a style element, which is nested within the  head element. The style element has opening and closing tags.This method should only be used if a site is being built with one web page. </p>
            <p style="color: white;">Inline stylesheets are applied to HTML page by adding the  style attribute to the element you want to style. The CSS rules will only apply to that one element</p>
